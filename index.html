    		<h2 class="title"> About me </h2>
    		<p> My name is Celine. <img class ="profil" src="image/me.png" alt="Profil Picture"> </p>
    		<p> I'm a 19 years old girl studying User Experience design at the Hague University. I come from France and been living there all my life, so coming to the Netherlands was for me a big step. I speak fluent french but also english and a bit of dutch. </p>
    		<p> I would describe myself as a super curious person with various interest! I spend most of my time reading online or watching videos. Almost every type of art is interesting to me, especially painting and photography. In the futur, I wish to write a book, because it's something I really enjoy.</p>
    		<p> One of my hobbies is basketball, I've been playing since I was seven. Also, I like skying in the winter and sailing during the summer. </p>
